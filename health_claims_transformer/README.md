## üöÄ Quick Start

### Run the Complete Demo
```bash
# Try the from-scratch transformer
python src/example_usage.py

# Explore the practical AI pipeline
python practical_ai_pipeline.py

# Calculate hardware requirements
python hardware_calculator.py
```

### Interactive Learning

## üìä Project Scope

**Training Configuration Mastery:**
- Learning rates: 1e-6 to 1e-3 (understand safe boundaries)
- Epochs: Overfitting prevention strategies
- Batch sizes: Memory vs stability trade-offs
- Warmup steps: Gentle training acceleration
- Weight decay: Regularization for generalization

**Real-World Context:**
- Medical claims processing (fraud detection, anomaly identification)
- HIPAA compliance and data privacy
- Business cost analysis (false positives vs negatives)
- Production deployment considerations

## üí° Key Insights Gained

1. **Learning rates are dimensionless scaling factors** - tiny numbers make sense when affecting millions of parameters
2. **Warmup is gradual learning rate increase** - prevents shocking pre-trained models
3. **Fine-tuning preserves knowledge** - much different from training from scratch
4. **Most AI work is practical deployment** - not building models from scratch
5. **Parameter interactions matter** - changing one often requires adjusting others

## üéØ Perfect For

- **AI Engineers** wanting to understand transformers deeply
- **Students** bridging theory to practice
- **Practitioners** needing production AI deployment knowledge
- **Anyone** curious about how modern AI actually works
