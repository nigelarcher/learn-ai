# Transformer Blocks Explained

## What This File Does

The `transformer.py` file implements the complete transformer architecture by combining all components:
- Encoder blocks: Process input sequences (claims data)
- Decoder blocks: Generate output sequences (assessments)
- Feed-forward networks: Non-linear transformations
- Residual connections: Enable deep networks

## Why It's Important

For health insurance claims:

- **Encoder**: Understands complex claim documents with medical codes, procedures, and costs
- **Decoder**: Generates structured assessments (approved/denied, payment amounts, risk scores)
- **Deep Architecture**: Captures intricate policy rules and medical relationships
- **Parallel Processing**: Processes entire claims at once, not sequentially

## How It Contributes to Learning

Building complete transformer blocks teaches:

1. **Architecture Design**: How components fit together
2. **Residual Connections**: Why they're crucial for deep networks
3. **Parameter Initialization**: Xavier/He initialization for stable training
4. **Memory Management**: O(n²) attention memory requirements

## Architecture Overview

### Encoder Block
```
Input → Multi-Head Attention → Add & Norm → FFN → Add & Norm → Output
```

### Decoder Block
```
Input → Masked Self-Attention → Add & Norm → 
Cross-Attention → Add & Norm → FFN → Add & Norm → Output
```

### Feed-Forward Network
```
FFN(x) = max(0, xW₁ + b₁)W₂ + b₂
```

## Medical Claims Processing Flow

1. **Input Embedding**: Claim text → token embeddings
2. **Positional Encoding**: Add sequence position information
3. **Encoder Stack**: Extract claim features
4. **Decoder Stack**: Generate assessment
5. **Output Projection**: Convert to final predictions

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Pre-Layer Normalization**: More stable training than post-norm
2. **Dropout**: Prevent overfitting on specific claim patterns
3. **Width vs Depth**: Balancing model capacity and training difficulty
4. **Attention Heads**: Multiple perspectives on claim relationships
