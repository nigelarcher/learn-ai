# Claims Processor and Anomaly Detection Explained

## What This File Does

The `claims_processor.py` file implements the practical application layer that:
- Processes raw insurance claims through the transformer
- Assesses claim validity and calculates payment amounts
- Detects anomalies that might indicate fraud or errors
- Provides interpretable explanations for decisions

## Why It's Important

For health insurance operations:

- **Automated Assessment**: Reduces manual review from days to seconds
- **Consistency**: Applies policy rules uniformly across all claims
- **Fraud Detection**: Identifies unusual patterns that humans might miss
- **Explainability**: Provides reasons for approval/denial decisions

## How It Contributes to Learning

Building the claims processor teaches:

1. **Model Application**: How to use transformer outputs for business decisions
2. **Threshold Tuning**: Balancing false positives vs false negatives
3. **Feature Engineering**: Extracting meaningful signals from attention patterns
4. **Production Considerations**: Handling edge cases and errors gracefully

## Key Components

### Claim Assessment Pipeline
1. **Preprocessing**: Extract structured data from claim
2. **Encoding**: Convert to model input format
3. **Inference**: Run through transformer
4. **Post-processing**: Convert outputs to decisions
5. **Explanation**: Generate human-readable reasons

### Anomaly Detection Methods

1. **Statistical Anomalies**
   - Unusual cost for procedure code
   - Rare diagnosis-procedure combinations
   - Atypical provider billing patterns

2. **Attention-Based Anomalies**
   - Unusual attention patterns
   - Low confidence predictions
   - Inconsistent information focus

3. **Temporal Anomalies**
   - Duplicate claims
   - Impossible procedure sequences
   - Backdated submissions

## Business Rules Integration

The processor combines ML predictions with hard rules:
- Policy coverage limits
- Pre-authorization requirements
- Network restrictions
- Exclusion lists

## Fraud Indicators

Common patterns detected:
1. **Upcoding**: Billing for more expensive procedures
2. **Unbundling**: Splitting procedures that should be billed together
3. **Phantom Billing**: Services never rendered
4. **Identity Theft**: Claims under stolen identities

## Production Safeguards

1. **Confidence Thresholds**: Route low-confidence claims to human review
2. **Explanation Requirements**: Every decision must have clear reasoning
3. **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all decisions
4. **Override Capability**: Humans can always override ML decisions
