# Computational Requirements and Scaling

## What This Document Covers

This document details the computational requirements, memory usage, and scaling considerations for deploying a transformer model for health insurance claims processing in production.

## Why It's Important

Understanding computational requirements is crucial for:
- **Budget Planning**: Cloud compute costs can be significant
- **Architecture Decisions**: Choosing between model size and inference speed
- **Team Skills**: Knowing what expertise is needed for deployment
- **Scaling Strategy**: Planning for growth from 1K to 1M claims/day

## Computational Complexity

### Attention Mechanism
- **Time Complexity**: O(n²d) where n is sequence length, d is model dimension
- **Memory Complexity**: O(n²) for attention scores
- **Example**: 512 token sequence = 262,144 attention scores per head

### Full Model
- **Parameters**: ~50M for a 6-layer, 512-dim model
- **FLOPs per token**: ~6 * (12 * d²) for transformer layers
- **Memory**: ~400MB for model weights + activation memory

## Memory Requirements

### Training
```
Memory = Model_Weights + Gradients + Optimizer_States + Activations
       = 50M * 4 bytes + 50M * 4 + 50M * 8 (Adam) + Batch_Activations
       = ~800MB + (Batch_Size * Seq_Length * Layers * Hidden_Size * 4)
```

For batch_size=32, seq_len=512:
- ~4-8GB GPU memory required

### Inference
```
Memory = Model_Weights + Single_Batch_Activations
       = 200MB + (Seq_Length * Layers * Hidden_Size * 4)
       = ~500MB per request
```

## Scaling Considerations

### Vertical Scaling (Bigger Models)
- **Pros**: Better accuracy, handles complex claims
- **Cons**: Higher latency, more expensive
- **Sweet Spot**: 6-12 layers for claims processing

### Horizontal Scaling (More Instances)
- **Pros**: Linear throughput increase
- **Cons**: Orchestration complexity
- **Implementation**: Load balancer + multiple GPU instances

### Optimization Techniques

1. **Quantization**: Reduce precision to INT8
   - 4x memory reduction
   - 2-4x speedup
   - <1% accuracy loss

2. **Knowledge Distillation**: Train smaller model
   - 10x smaller student model
   - 5x faster inference
   - 2-3% accuracy loss

3. **Caching**: Store embeddings for common claims
   - 50% reduction for repeat procedures
   - Minimal memory overhead

## Production Deployment

### Hardware Requirements

**Development/Testing**:
- CPU: 8+ cores
- RAM: 16GB
- GPU: Optional (1x GTX 1080 or better)

**Production (1K claims/day)**:
- CPU: 16+ cores
- RAM: 32GB
- GPU: 1x V100 or A10

**Scale (100K claims/day)**:
- CPU: 32+ cores per instance
- RAM: 64GB per instance
- GPU: 4x A100 or equivalent
- Load balancer + 4-8 instances

### Cost Estimates (AWS)

**Small Scale (1K claims/day)**:
- Instance: g4dn.xlarge
- Cost: ~$500/month

**Medium Scale (10K claims/day)**:
- Instance: g4dn.2xlarge
- Cost: ~$1,000/month

**Large Scale (100K claims/day)**:
- Instances: 4x p3.2xlarge
- Cost: ~$10,000/month

## Engineering Team Skills

### Required Skills
1. **ML Engineering**: Model optimization, deployment
2. **DevOps**: Kubernetes, monitoring, scaling
3. **Backend**: API development, caching, queuing
4. **Data Engineering**: Pipeline for claims preprocessing

### Team Structure
- **Minimum**: 1 ML Engineer + 1 DevOps
- **Recommended**: 2 ML Engineers + 1 DevOps + 1 Backend
- **Scale**: Add Data Engineers and SREs

## Performance Benchmarks

### Latency Targets
- **Single claim**: <100ms
- **Batch (32 claims)**: <500ms
- **End-to-end API**: <200ms

### Throughput
- **Per GPU**: ~1000 claims/minute
- **Per CPU (quantized)**: ~100 claims/minute

### Accuracy vs Speed Trade-offs
1. **Full Model**: 95% accuracy, 100ms/claim
2. **Quantized**: 94% accuracy, 25ms/claim
3. **Distilled**: 92% accuracy, 10ms/claim

## Monitoring and Observability

### Key Metrics
- **Model Metrics**: Accuracy, confidence distribution
- **System Metrics**: Latency, throughput, GPU utilization
- **Business Metrics**: Claims processed, approval rate, fraud caught

### Alerting Thresholds
- Latency > 500ms
- Accuracy < 90%
- GPU utilization > 90%
- Error rate > 1%

## Future Scaling Paths

1. **Model Parallelism**: Split large models across GPUs
2. **Mixture of Experts**: Specialized models for claim types
3. **Edge Deployment**: Process simple claims on edge devices
4. **Federated Learning**: Train on distributed hospital data

## Conclusion

Scaling transformers for health insurance claims requires careful balance between accuracy and efficiency. Start with a moderate-sized model, implement caching and quantization early, and plan for horizontal scaling as volume grows. The investment in proper infrastructure pays off through reduced manual review costs and faster claim processing.
