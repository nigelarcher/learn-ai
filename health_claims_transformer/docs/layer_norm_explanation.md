# Layer Normalization Explained

## What This File Does

The `layer_norm.py` file implements layer normalization, a crucial component for training deep transformers. It normalizes activations across features (not across batch like BatchNorm), making training more stable.

## Why It's Important

For health insurance claims processing:

- **Training Stability**: Medical terminology has vastly different frequency distributions (common symptoms vs rare conditions)
- **Gradient Flow**: Prevents vanishing/exploding gradients in deep models processing long claim documents
- **Feature Scale**: Normalizes between different feature types (numeric codes, text descriptions, monetary values)

## How It Contributes to Learning

Building layer normalization teaches:

1. **Normalization Theory**: Why we normalize and where in the network
2. **Gradient Dynamics**: How normalization affects backpropagation
3. **Numerical Stability**: Handling small epsilon values and numerical precision
4. **Parameter Efficiency**: Why LayerNorm works better than BatchNorm for transformers

## Key Formulas

### Layer Normalization

```
y = γ * (x - μ) / √(σ² + ε) + β
```

Where:
- x: Input activations
- μ: Mean across features
- σ²: Variance across features
- γ: Learned scale parameter
- β: Learned shift parameter
- ε: Small constant for numerical stability

### Gradients

The backpropagation through LayerNorm involves:
1. Gradient w.r.t normalized input
2. Gradient w.r.t variance
3. Gradient w.r.t mean
4. Gradient w.r.t input

## Implementation Challenges

1. **Numerical Precision**: Handling very small variances
2. **Gradient Computation**: Complex chain rule application
3. **Memory Efficiency**: Caching intermediate values for backward pass

## Medical Claims Context

Layer normalization helps with:
- **Mixed Data Types**: Claims contain text (diagnoses), codes (ICD-10), and numbers (costs)
- **Scale Variations**: Costs can range from $10 to $1M
- **Sparse Features**: Rare medical conditions appear infrequently
